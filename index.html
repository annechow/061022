    <p><i>tw: sexual assault</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>an episode of sex education made me cry the other day.
    <p>it was the way that aimee was scared to smile at strangers—because the last time that she did that, a sick, perverted guy took out his penis on a crowded bus and came on her favorite jeans—</p>
    <p>i felt it raw and visceral, a shock of recognition and pain and familiar fear that shot through my spine. because i knew what it felt like to have that trust broken: not only in the world, but in yourself. <i>did i do this? is this because of me?</i> and you know that it is not, because logically you did not ask for it, you did not want it, and it was your right to exist and not be assaulted. but still you keep thinking, <i>maybe if i hadn't done this, or maybe if i had said this instead—</i></p>
    <p>and that is the thing about sexual assault. because people may think it is an isolated, compartmentalized memory. but it is a fear. a breaking of trust and self-worth that percolates through your entire body.</p>
    <p>fear... and <b>anger</b>, too.</p>

    <br>

    <p>truthfully, i had forgotten a lot of it. but aimee said, i used to enjoy sex, <b>i used to love my body</b>, and then i thought, <i>i remember that.</i></p>
    <p>she said, i need to be alone, <b>i can't be stand to be touched by a man</b>, and then i thought, <i>i remember that.</i></p>
    <p>and then she was told i will never be the same again, but <b>i can learn how to heal</b> and i thought, <i>yes, i remember that, that is what i learned too.</i></p>

    <br>

    <p>i read a book once that compared your relationship to sex as a garden. each person is in charge of cultivating their own tiny plot of land: you learn to care for it, painstakingly and slowly letting it thrive as you understand what seeds of love to plant and what weeds of shame to uproot.</p>

    <p><b>realization one: sex is vulnerability.</b></p>

    <p>i loved my flowers until my garden's soil was upturned. it hurt me so much to have them torn away. but i couldn't touch them again, couldn't even look at them, because every time i did i thought of petals being ripped apart and leaves being trampled and me, frozen, unable to say anything as the boy i trusted most told me that he found pleasure in making me cry. <i>why was i unable to say anything?</i></p>

    <p>all i had ever planted was gone. i was furious—with him, with myself. i vowed i would never allow this to happen again.</p>

    <p><b>realization two: vulnerability is not weakness.</b></p>

    <p>i remember when i met the one who would become my best friend, the one who would convince me to forgive myself. his kisses were gentle; rather than shrivel, under them i bloomed. i didn't even know it was happening until i realized i had slowly learned to trust myself again. to open my heart.</p>

    <p>my anger turned to forgiveness. my fear turned to hope. together we began to plant new flowers.</p>

    <p><b>realization three: vulnerability is pleasure.</b></p>

    <p>even now, i still remember what it felt like, to hate being naked, to fear anyone's touch. i remember crying in the middle of the day, hiding from my friends, blood hot flashbacks to the deepest betrayal i'd ever known. i remember being scared to love.</p>

    <p>i have never been a patient person, and gardens take some time to cultivate. still: come spring, i was finally joyful and fresh with new life.</p>

    <p>true, i will never be the same person again. but i still like flowers. and the ones i cherish now—i have learned that they are not meant to survive harsh conditions. they are tenderness and care. they sway in the wind and turn their faces to the sun, whispering i am here and i am unafraid.</p>
