  <h1>memory.</h1>
    <div id="main">
    <p>an episode of sex ed made me cry the other day.
    <p>it was the way that aimee was scared to smile at strangers - because the last time that she did that, a sick, perverted guy took out his penis on a crowded bus and came on her favorite jeans -</p>
    <p>i felt it raw and visceral, a shock of recognition and pain and familiar fear that shot through my spine. because i knew what it felt like to have that trust broken: not only in the world, but in yourself. <i>did i do this? is this because of me?</i> and you know that it is not, because logically you did not ask for it, you did not want it, and it was your right to  exist and not be assaulted. but still you keep thinking, <i>maybe if i hadn't done this, or maybe if i had said this instead -</i></p>
    <p>and that is the thing about sexual assault. because people may think it is an isolated, compartmentalized memory. but it is a fear. a breaking of trust and self-worth that percolates through your entire body.</p>
    <p>fear... and <b>anger</b>, too.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>truthfully, i had forgotten a lot of it. but aimee said, i used to enjoy sex, <b>i used to love my body</b>, and then i thought, <i>i remember that.</i></p>
    <p>she said, <b>i can't be stand to be touched by a man</b>, and then i thought, <i>i remember that.</i></p>
    <p>and then she was told <b>i will never be the same again, but i can learn how to heal</b> and i thought, <i>yes, i remember that, that is what i learned too.</i>
